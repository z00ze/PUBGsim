This was an project where I tried to verify does the Blue Circle in the Player Unknown's Battleground-game be affected by the positions of the player.
The telemetry data of 100 matches was retrieved from their API, as this was computational heavy, this process was multithreaded. 
Thank you Ryzen for fast calculations.

When Blue Circle appeared in the game, all player positions were looked and checked are they inside the circle and how far away they are.

End result was that I could not determine did the Blue Circle take into account players positions.
When I have time, I could try with bigger data set.
